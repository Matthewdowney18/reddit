examples_npt
the purpose of this experiment is to determine what the optimal length
of the sequences are. the classifier was trained on 20, 25, and 30
examples. the results show that accuracy goes up as the max length goes
up. this may be because the number of available training examples goes
up along with the max length. this is very likely because the examples
experiment shows the trend of more training examples results in a higher
accuracy.
